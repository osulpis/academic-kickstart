title: Cold-water CO2 systems
summary: Seawater samples from polar regions are challenging to gather. In turn, this lack of data makes CO<sub>2</sub>-system predictions in cold, polar waters poorly constrained and uncertain.

## **North-West Passage**

Juan de Fuca, who gave his name to a [tectonic plate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/07/tectonic-plate-dying-oregon-why-matters/), a [strait](https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/juandefuca.htm), and a [50-m tall rock](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/113155505/fuca-pillar), was a famous Greek explorer who may actually have [never existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Fuca#Controversy). Fuca was looking for new ways to reach from Europe the land of Genghis Khan as described by Marco Polo. Instead of going East, like Polo did, he tried to look for the mythical North-West passage. 

A few decades after Colomb's trips to America, two ways to the Pacific were already known: the Strait of Magellan at the south of Chili, and the Isthmus of Panama. An alternative, North-West passage, which would be closer to Europe, was yet to be discovered. Generations of marine explorers had tried since the 1250s to find the entrance of the North-west passage, with attempts from both the Atlantic and the Pacific sides. In 1592, Juan de Fuca, after one of his expeditions, described the entrance of a passage on the west coast of Canada, through which he sailed for 20 days, before turning back. That passage, which he claimed to be the North-West passage, made sailors fantasize for centuries. It was only in 1792 that [George Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Vancouver) found out the truth about the passage discovered by Juan de Fuca: it was not the North-West passage, but simply a path around the Vancouver island. According to Vancouver, there were no North-West passage south of the Bering strait. 
It is only in the early 20th century, after the [Franklin's lost expedition](https://secretsoftheice.com/news/2019/10/28/franklin-expedition/), that Roald Amundsen became the first man who successfully navigated the [North-West Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVY8LoM47xI) by boat, on a voyage that lasted from 1903 to 1906.

Here are a couple of pictures about expeditions I have been involved in, in the Canadian Arctic between 2016 and 2019, where I was measuring seawater pH, total alkalinity and surface pCO<sub>2</sub> as a part of the [Arcticnet](https://arcticnet.ulaval.ca/) program.

There are no dock in the Arctic! The best way to safely reach a ship from land is often via the air.

Phytoplankton, or plants that can't swim, need sunlight and nutrients to live and be happy. In the Arctic, in the winter, because there are ice sheets covering the surface ocean, the amount of sunlight reaching the water is very small and plankton cannot grow. Nutrients stay there, waiting to be eaten. When the ice sheet melts in the spring, there is suddenly plenty of light reaching the surface waters. Plankton get super excited and eat all the food. This lasts a couple of weeks and then they die, not because there is no light because they have eaten all the food. Nutrients are replenished slowly, brought by dust and rivers, but by the time enough food is back into the surface ocean, it's winter again, there is no light any more. Then spring comes again, ice melts, plankton eat all the food, they die. It happens every year. But why don't they go more slowly on eating food when the spring comes, you ask? Don't they ever learn from their mistakes? Well, not really, they have no brain. They think short term, and live an intense life, using all their resources at once, without thinking about future generations. Does that remind you of someone?
