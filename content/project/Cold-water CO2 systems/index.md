## **North-West Passage**

Juan de Fuca, who gave his name to a [tectonic plate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/07/tectonic-plate-dying-oregon-why-matters/), a [strait](https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/juandefuca.htm), and a [50-m tall rock](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/113155505/fuca-pillar), was a famous Greek explorer who may actually have [never existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Fuca#Controversy). Fuca was looking for new ways to reach from Europe the land of Genghis Khan as described by Marco Polo. Instead of going East, like Polo did, he tried to look for the mythical North-West passage. 

A few decades after Colomb's trips to America, two ways to the Pacific were already known: the Strait of Magellan at the south of Chili, and the Isthmus of Panama. An alternative, North-West passage, which would be closer to Europe, was yet to be discovered. Generations of marine explorers had tried since the 1250s to find the entrance of the North-west passage, with attempts from both the Atlantic and the Pacific sides. In 1592, Juan de Fuca, after one of his expeditions, described the entrance of a passage on the west coast of Canada, through which he sailed for 20 days, before turning back. That passage, which he claimed to be the North-West passage, made sailors fantasize for centuries. It was only in 1792 that [George Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Vancouver) found out the truth about the passage discovered by Juan de Fuca: it was not the North-West passage, but simply a path around the Vancouver island. According to Vancouver, there were no North-West passage south of the Bering strait. 

It is only in the early 20th century, after the [Franklin's lost expedition](https://secretsoftheice.com/news/2019/10/28/franklin-expedition/), that Roald Amundsen became the first man who successfully navigated the [North-West Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVY8LoM47xI) by boat, on a voyage that lasted from 1903 to 1906.

Here are a couple of pictures about expeditions I have been involved in, in the Canadian Arctic between 2016 and 2019, where I was measuring seawater pH, total alkalinity and surface pCO<sub>2</sub> as a part of the [Arcticnet](https://arcticnet.ulaval.ca/) program.

In the winter, when seawater is brought back on the deck and in contact with cold air at - 20 or - 30 degrees Celcius, it is only a matter of seconds before it starts freezing. One must act fast!

pH measurements are usually performed on board, at a temperature of 25 degrees Celcius. On one hand, one would want to measure seawater pH fast after sampling, to avoid CO<sub>2</sub> exchanges with the air. On the other hand, it may take several long minutes before a seawater sample warms up and reaches a stable temperature. This, combined with the challenge of sampling seawater in sea ice covered regions, makes pH measurements from cold water regions challenging to obtain.

## **CO<sub>2</sub> system in cold water**

Seawater absorption of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has led to a range of changes in carbonate chemistry, collectively referred to as ocean acidification. Stoichiometric dissociation constants (the K values) used to convert measured carbonate system variables (pH, pCO<sub>2</sub>, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity) into globally comparable parameters are crucial for accurately quantifying these changes. The temperature and salinity coefficients of these constants have generally been experimentally derived under controlled laboratory conditions. In a study under review in [Ocean Sciences](https://www.ocean-sci-discuss.net/os-2020-19/), we use field measurements of carbonate system variables taken from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2 and the Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas databases to evaluate the temperature dependence of the carbonic acid stoichiometric dissociation constants. By applying a [novel iterative procedure](https://zenodo.org/record/3725889), we show that the set of equilibrium constants currently preferred by the ocean acidification are not consistent with measured CO<sub>2</sub> system parameters at low temperatures, below about 8 degrees Celcius. This is important, since most of the ocean seawater has a temperature lower than this value.

{{< figure src="" title="The K values are actually not constant, but a function of temperature, pressure and salinity." >}}

Given past difficulties to obtain direct pCO<sub>2</sub> measurements from ships in the Southern Ocean, a number of autonomous floats have been deployed in the recent years. Since these floats estimate pCO<sub>2</sub> from a pH measurement and a calculated total alkalinity (TA), our knowledge of surface pCO<sub>2</sub> in the Southern Ocean strongly relies on the accuracy of dissociation constants in these cold waters.

{{< figure src="" title="Variables of the CO<sub>2</sub> cannot always be directly measured, and must be computed, relying on accurate equilibrium constants." >}}

Results from this research indicates the need for further measurements to reduce the uncertainty in the carbonic acid stoichiometric dissociation constants. The ocean CO<sub>2</sub> sink is immensely important, and currently estimated to remove ~25% of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. If the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by the Southern Ocean, where low temperatures are common, is much smaller than previously estimated, there must be missing sinks elsewhere in the Earth System, be it in the oceanic or terrestrial realm. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the dynamics of the ocean carbon sink, including its regional and temporal variability.
