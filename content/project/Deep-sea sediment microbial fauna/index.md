title: Deep-sea sediment microbial fauna
summary: The seafloor is home to a myriad of unknown microbes, who decompose organic matter and drive calcium carbonates dissolution, thus influencing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. We will explore these microbial fauna, and characterize the nature and reactivity of organic matter, by deploying microsensors at the bottom of the ocean in an upcoming cruise.

The seafloor, which covers ~70% of the surface of the planet and moderates the transfer of materials and energy from the biosphere to the geosphere, remains for the vast majority unexplored and unmapped. Today, this rich, unknown ecosystem is locally threatened by deep-sea mining activities, e.g. by ploughing of the top layers of the seabed, which contains abundant valuable minerals and metals essential to the energy transition [1]. The deep ocean is also perturbed globally by climate change, including seawater acidification caused by the addition of ~ 10 billion tons of human-made carbon dioxide (CO2) per year into the oceans.

Ocean acidification, which refers to the observed decrease in seawater pH [2], promotes the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals, plentiful at the seabed. CaCO3 minerals are the main constituents of the shells of many planktonic organisms, and these accumulate at the seafloor upon their death. For every molecule of CaCO3 that dissolves, about one molecule of CO2 is being neutralized. As there are far more CaCO3 minerals stored in marine sediments than human activities can potentially release as CO2, CaCO3 dissolution at the seafloor will be the ultimate sink for anthropogenic CO2 on timescales of decades to millennia [3]. Thus, knowing the rate at which anthropogenic CaCO3 dissolution will occur is required to predict future ocean acidification and take adequate mitigation actions.

Yet, the key processes that govern CaCO3 dissolution at the surface of the seafloor are still obscure: it involves chemistry, physics and biology. Physical processes (tides and other sea currents) determine the near-bottom hydrodynamics and thus the transfer of materials to and from the bottom. The bottom-water chemistry sets the thermodynamic drive (degree of undersaturation of carbonate minerals) [4]. Fresh organic matter delivered to the sediments is degraded by microbes and other consumers, resulting in the release of respiratory carbon dioxide. This locally acidifies the sediment porewaters (the water between the sediment particles), which, in principle, could cause some of the CaCO3 particles to dissolve. Because the deep seafloor is mostly uncharted, and its many of its inhabitants are yet to be discovered, it is virtually impossible to model and thus accurately predict the role of respiratory carbon dioxide in sediment CaCO3 dissolution, nor how this will evolve in the future.
