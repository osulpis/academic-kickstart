title: Deep-sea sediment microbial fauna
summary: The seafloor is home to a myriad of unknown microbes, who decompose organic matter and drive calcium carbonates dissolution, thus influencing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. We will explore these microbial fauna, and characterize the nature and reactivity of organic matter, by deploying microsensors at the bottom of the ocean in an upcoming cruise.
