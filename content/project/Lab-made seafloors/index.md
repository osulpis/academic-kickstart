## **Phase 3**: Effects of organic matter and mineralogy on carbonate mineral dissolution [NIOZ]

Funding was received from [NIOZ](https://www.nioz.nl/en/education/uu-nioz-student-work-experience-1) to hire a student and pursue a research summer-project about the **effects of organic matter and mineralogy on carbonate mineral dissolution**. This should take place in summer 2020 or 2021 in collaboration with [Dr. Matthew Humphreys](https://mvdh.xyz/).

Background:
The shells of many planktonic organisms are composed of carbonate minerals (e.g. CaCO<sub>3</sub>). These cover a large part of the seafloor where they act as a giant antacid tablet, protecting the oceans against human-made acidification caused by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Environmental conditions representative of the deep sea can be generated in the laboratory using new rotating-disc reactors, in which discs loaded with sediment are rotated in a chamber of seawater. Recent studies with these reactors have shed new light on the relative importance of different controls on the dissolution rate, with significant consequences for projections of future ocean acidification. However, the effects of varying sediment mineralogy and the presence of organic matter remain to be quantified.

Work description:
We plan to build a set of rotating-disc reactors at NIOZ in spring 2020 (i.e. before the student arrives), in collaboration with colleagues from McGill University (Montreal, Canada). The student would run dissolution experiments using sediments and seawater collected/stored at NIOZ, comparing the results with previous studies in order to validate the method and investigating previously untested sediment compositions. The dissolution reactions will be monitored by the student using the NIOZ carbonate system laboratory facilities.

**Stay tuned!**

## **What's next?**

Here are some of the analytical developments that could be implemented:
- Continuous flow analysis
- Foil
- Microelectrodes from above and below
