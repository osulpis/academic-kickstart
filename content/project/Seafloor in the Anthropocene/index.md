## **Carbonating the ocean**

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere is absorbed by our oceans, and has an important impact on our oceanic ecosystems. When an ocean absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> in large quantities its chemistry changes, and it becomes more acidic. However, the oceans have their very own antacid: a mineral called calcium carbonate, which comprises the exteriors of some marine organisms - clams, oysters, starfish, coccolithophores, coral, and others. Like an antacid, these minerals help to buffer the acidity of the ocean by dissolving and producing a charged molecule called carbonate, which can effectively neutralize acid.

## **The seafloor is dissolving because of humans**

The geological record contains numerous examples of “greenhouse periods” and ocean acidification episodes, where the spreading of corrosive (CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched) bottom waters enhances the dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> minerals delivered to the seafloor or contained within deep-sea sediments. The dissolution of sedimentary CaCO<sub>3</sub> neutralizes excess CO<sub>2</sub>, thus preventing runaway acidification, and acts as a negative-feedback mechanism in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels over timescales of centuries to millennia. We report an observation-based indication and quantification of significant CaCO3 dissolution at the seafloor caused by man-made CO<sub>2</sub>. This dissolution is already occurring at various locations in the deep ocean, particularly in the northern Atlantic and near the Southern Ocean, where the bottom waters are young and rich in anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>.

This research, published in PNAS, has received broad media coverage with more than 170 press articles from 38 countries. Read a selection of articles on the topic:

## **Forecast for the 21st century**: warm, sluggish and muddy

Describe GBC paper

## **What's next?**

The good news is that there are far more calcium carbonate at the seafloor than there are carbon dioxide under the form of fossil fuel that we can possibly burn.
