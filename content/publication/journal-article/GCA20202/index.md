abstract: The diffusive boundary layer (DBL) is a thin layer of fluid at the interface with a solid surface in which frictional forces cause molecular diffusion to become the dominant mode of solute transport. The thickness of the DBL is a function of the nature and roughness of sediment substrates, as well as the bottom-current speed. In low-energy natural aquatic environments, such as abyssal plains or lakes, the thickness of the DBL can reach several millimeters and significantly impede the diffusive rate of solutes through the sediment–water interface (SWI). Thus, precisely reproducing the DBL in the laboratory is required to simulate benthic diffusive fluxes similar to those encountered in situ. Yet, an experimental apparatus allowing precise control of the DBL thickness at the SWI in the laboratory has not been described in the literature. Here, we present a simple temperature-controlled rotating-disk system, which is suitable for the use with natural sediments and that is capable of generating thick DBLs. Water overlying the rotating sediment can be sampled discretely or continuously to monitor the chemical reaction progress. We tested the validity of the reactor by dissolving a foraminiferal sand bed in natural seawater. We find that (1) measured dissolution fluxes agree with those predicted by theory and (2) the dissolution of calcite in these seafloor-like hydrodynamic conditions is controlled by mass transfer across the DBL above the bed. Guidelines for best practices under various experimental conditions, possible future developments, and the theoretical equations to compute the DBL thickness and diffusive fluxes in this reactor are described.
