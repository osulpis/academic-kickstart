abstract: Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> leads to decreased pH, carbonate ion concentration, and saturation state with respect to CaCO<sub>3</sub> minerals, causing increased dissolution of these minerals at the deep seafloor. This additional dissolution will figure prominently in the neutralization of man-made CO<sub>2</sub>. However, there has been no concerted assessment of the current extent of anthropogenic CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution at the deep seafloor. Here, recent databases of bottom-water chemistry, benthic currents, and CaCO3 content of deep-sea sediments are combined with a rate model to derive the global distribution of benthic calcite dissolution rates and obtain primary confirmation of an anthropogenic component. By comparing preindustrial with present-day rates, we determine that significant anthropogenic dissolution now occurs in the western North Atlantic, amounting to 40–100% of the total seafloor dissolution at its most intense locations. At these locations, the calcite compensation depth has risen ~300 m. Increased benthic dissolution was also revealed at various hot spots in the southern extent of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Our findings place constraints on future predictions of ocean acidification, are consequential to the fate of benthic calcifiers, and indicate that a by-product of human activities is currently altering the geological record of the deep sea.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The geological record contains numerous examples of “greenhouse periods” and ocean acidification episodes, where the spreading of corrosive (CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched) bottom waters enhances the dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> minerals delivered to the seafloor or contained within deep-sea sediments. The dissolution of sedimentary CaCO<sub>3</sub> neutralizes excess CO<sub>2</sub>, thus preventing runaway acidification, and acts as a negative-feedback mechanism in regulating atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels over timescales of centuries to millennia. We report here the first signs of significant CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution at the seafloor caused by man-made CO<sub>2</sub>. This dissolution is already occurring at various locations in the deep ocean, particularly in the northern Atlantic and near the Southern Ocean, where the bottom waters are young and rich in anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>.
